-- 5.Get name and email from customers from Canada using subqueries. Do the same with joins. Note that to create a join, 
-- you will have to identify the correct tables with their primary keys and foreign keys, that will help you get the relevant information.

-- 6.Which are films starred by the most prolific actor? Most prolific actor is defined as the actor that has acted in the most number of films. 
-- First you will have to find the most prolific actor and then use that actor_id to find the different films that he/she starred.
SELECT a.actor_id,a.first_name,a.last_name, count(fa.actor_id) AS total_amount
FROM sakila.film_actor as fa

where actor_id = 88);
-- I cannot select the most prolific actor in the subquery since we cannot use limit in the subquery,So what Iâ€™ve done is just just to subquery seperatly.
-- By first subquery we know that the actor id of the most prolofic actor is 88,then we use it directly in the second subquery.


-- 7.Films rented by most profitable customer. You can use the customer table and payment table to find the most profitable customer ie the customer that has made the largest sum of payments

select customer_id,sum(amount) from sakila.payment
group by customer_id
order by sum(amount) desc
limit 1;
-- the most profitable customer number is 526
SELECT title FROM film
WHERE film_id IN (
	SELECT film_id FROM inventory
    WHERE store_id IN(
		SELECT store_id  FROM customer
        WHERE customer_id=526));
-- we select the film which is rented by this customer by fix the customer_id

-- 8.Customers who spent more than the average payments.
select customer_id ,avg(amount) from sakila.payment; 
-- the average payment is around 4.20
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name FROM customer
WHERE customer_id IN (
	SELECT customer_id FROM payment
    WHERE amount > 4.20);
